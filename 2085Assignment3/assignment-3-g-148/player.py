        Complexity : Worst-Case complexity = O(M + T + F*( C*logC + C*logC )) = O(M + T + F*C*logC)
                     Best-Case complexity = O(M + T + F*C) 

        The worst complexity is O(M + T + F*C*logC). O(M) is from the first for loop that is iterating through the list of materials and inside the loop only consists of O(1) operations.
        The same applies to O(T) that is from the second for loop iterating through the list of traders and inside the loop only consists of O(1) operations. O(F*C*log*C) is from 
        the third for loop that iterates through the list of food O(F) and consists of two nested for loop of O(C*log C) where log C is from inserting and removing caves from the
        AVL tree. 

        The best case happens only when the operation of inserting the cave into the AVL tree is O(1) and also find_max_and_remove() function is O(1). These operations can be O(1)
        if and only if the there is only 1 cave in self.caves.

        Approach : The first for loop (line 293) is to iterate through the whole list of materials to reset the current_best_price_for_sold and emerald_per_hunger_bar attribute 
        of the material everytime this method select_food_and_caves() is called. This is to erase all the previously set values from the previous calls to this method. 
    
        The second for loop (line 298) is to iterate through the whole list of traders. At each iteration, the information in regards to the deal generated that is 
        the material and the selling price of that material of that particular trader are retrieved. The price of that material is then set to to the current_best_price_for_sold 
        attribute of the material.If there is a case where two or more different traders are buying the same item, only the highest price among them will be set to the 
        current_best_price_for_sold attribute of the material. The emerald per hunger bar of each material is then calculated by using the current_best_price_for_sold of the material
        divided by the mining rate. By using this emerald per hunger bar calculated for each material, better caves can be selected. In other words, a cave with the material of higher emerald 
        per hunger bar should be prioritised more against other caves with materials of lower emerald per hunger bar. Emerald per hunger bar shows how many emeralds the player can obtain by
        selling the material for each hunger bar used when mining.  

        The third for loop (line 310) is the main loop to choose the best choice of food and caves that will leave the highest balance at the end of the day.There is an if statement to check
        if the player has enough balance to buy the food.If not, the main loop will proceed to the next food.The first nested for loop (line 322) inside this main loop is to insert every 
        cave into an AVL tree which will sort the caves in accordance to the priority determined by the emerald per hunger bar of the material inside that cave. The second nested
        for loop (line 335) inside this main loop is to keep the game going. If the player's hunger bar is still not yet 0 , then the best cave which is the one that contains the material of the 
        highest emerald per hunger bar is retrieved from the AVL tree. Then, it will check if the player has enough hunger bar to mine the full quantity of material inside that cave. If no, 
        it will calculate the how much of the material can be mined by the player with the remaning hunger bar left. The balance of the player is then added with the price of selling
        by using the amount mined multiplied with the current_best_price_for_sold of that material.At the end of the loop, there is a if statement to check if the food bought at this iteration
        has a greater balance than the previous food. If it is greater, then it will set this current food as the most optimal solution. This main loop is done repeatedly untill either the 
        player's hunger bar is 0 or all the caves are already finished mining.

        

        Example :
        Player("Hello",50)
        Food :
        bread = Food("bread", 60, 30),
        rice = Food("Rice", 100, 28),

        Materials :
        gold = Material("Gold Nugget", 16.74)
        netherite = Material("Netherite Ingot", 21.58)
        fishing_rod = Material("Fishing Rod", 23.44)

        Caves:
        Cave("Ashfall's Tear", gold, 5)
        Cave("Benkongerike", netherite, 3)
        Cave("Blackbone Isle Grotto", gold, 4)
        Cave("Bleakcoast Cave", fishing_rod, 3)

        Traders:
        waldo = RandomTrader("Waldo Morgan") selling gold for 8 emeralds
        orson = RandomTrader("Orson Hoover") selling netherite for 6.50 emeralds
        lea = RandomTrader("Lea Carpenter") selling gold for 6.22 emeralds
        ruby = RandomTrader("Ruby Goodman") selling fishing rod for 7.54 emeralds

        Demonstration : 

        gold's current_best_price_for sold = 8 emeralds
        netherite's current_best_price_for = 6.50 emeralds
        fishing_rod's current_best_price_for = 7.54 emeralds

        for every material the emerald_per_hunger_bar is calculated,
        gold = 8 / 16.74 = 0.4779 emeralds/ hunger bar
        netherite = 6.50 / 21.58 = 0.3012 emeralds/ hunger bar
        fishing_rod = 7.54 / 23.44 =  0.32167 

        From the emerald_per_hunger_bar calculated, the caves' rankings are :
        1) Ashfall's Tear and Blackbone Isle Grotto (since they contain gold that has highest emerald_per_hunger_bar)
        2) Bleakcoast Cave ( since it contains fishing rod that has the second highest emerald_per_hunger_bar)
        3) Benkongerike ( since it contains netherite that has least emerald_per_hunger_bar )
