    def select_for_players(self, food: Food) -> tuple[list[Food|None], list[float], list[tuple[Cave, float]|None]]:
        """
        For each player, it selects the best cave such that by mining it, the player receives the highest amount of 
        emeralds when traded with a trader. Hence, it ensures that each player chooses the most optimal option.

        :param food: the food offered to the players in the Multiplayer game
        :returns: a list containing the food items or None depending on whether the player bought the Food, a list containing the temporary balances of every player, 
                  a list containing the caves (and the quantity mined from them) visited by each player or None if no Food was bought by the player.

        :complexity: Best-Case: O(M + T + C + C + P) = O(M + T + C + P). This case happens only when the best cases of both the get_max() and add() functions of MaxHeap are met.
                     In a scenario where after getting the max item from the heap, the last element of the heap does not sink to any position i.e. O(sink) = O(1) and also while 
                     adding an item to the heap, no the element does not rise to any position i.e. O(rise) = O(1), only then the complexity of this function would be O(M + T + C + P).

                     Worst_Case: O(M + T + C + C + P*(log C + log C)) = O(M + T + 2*C + 2*P*log C) = O(M + T + C + P*log C)     [since constants are ignored in Big-O complexity]

                     The complexity of the materials for loop (line 636) is O(M). Complexity of traders for loop (line 641) is O(T). Complexity of caves for loop (line 650) is O(C).
                     Complexity of players for loop (line 671) is O(P). A bottom-up heap is created in this function for which the complexity is always O(N) where N is the number of 
                     nodes to be added in the heap. Since a maximum of C nodes (length of self.caves) will be added to the heap, its complexity is O(C). The complexities of the get_max()
                     and add() functions of the heap are O(log C) * O(comparison) but since the comparison in this heap is done between keys of float types, O(comparison) = O(1). Thus, the
                     complexity of these functions becomes O(log C). All the other functions called in this function have a worst-case complexity of O(1). Based on these complexities, the 
                     overall complexity of tis function becomes O(M + T + C + P*log C)

        :approach: The primary purpose of this function is to select the cave which upon being mined, returns the highest emralds based on the trader's existing deals. So the approach was chosen
                   to calculate the emerald return for each cave and arrange these caves in a Max Heap by using their emerald returns as keys. The cave with the highest emerald return would be
                   placed at the top of the heap. Hence, for every player, the topmost item is extracted from the heap using the get_max() function. Following this, the chosen cave is added back to
                   the heap after the player has mined a certain quantity of material from the cave. Even when the cave is added back, the heap sets its position based on its new key by rising 
                   it up to the appropriate position. The traders loop (line 641) which is executed before the caves loop (line 650) sets the selling price for each material in the game based on 
                   the deals generated. This material price is then used to calculate the emrald returns of each cave in the calculate_cave_returns function. The emerald return of the caves was 
                   calculated without any data from the players as the multiplayer mode only offers a single food to all the players. Hence, the food price for all players will be the same which 
                   can thus be used to calculate the amount of material mined from each cave. 

                   A bottom up heap is constructed for the caves to arrange them in the descending order of their emerald returns. A bottom-up heap was chosen because it is the only adt which has a 
                   creation complexity of O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the heap. This heap can only be used when one is aware of all the items to be added into the heap before its creation. 
                   Since in this case, we already know the maximum number of nodes and have all the elements (caves) ready before the creation, we can use a bottom-up heap which eventually resulted
                   in a better efficiency in terms of time-complexity of the function.

        :example: A single day in a MultiPlayer Game is shown below:

                  Materials: 
                  gold = Material("gold Nugget", 27.24)
                  netherite = Material("Netherite Ingot", 20.95)
                  fishing_rod = Material("Fishing Rod", 26.93)

                  Traders:
                  waldo = RandomTrader("Waldo Morgan")
                  orson = RandomTrader("Orson Hoover")
                  lea = RandomTrader("Lea Carpenter")

                  Caves:
                  Cave("Boulderfall Cave", prismarine, 10)
                  Cave("Castle Karstaag Ruins", netherite, 4)
                  Cave("Glacial Cave", gold, 3)

                  Players:
                  Player("Rachit", 50)
                  Player("Jun Yu", 50)
                  Player("Jobin", 5)

                  Food:
                  Food("Cooked Chicken Cuts", 19, 19)

                  Demostration:
                  First each material's current best selling price is set to None.

                  Next, the traders set the price of each material based on the set deals:

                  waldo selling fishing rod for 10 emaralds
                  orson selling gold for 5 emeralds
                  lea selling netherite for 8 emeralds

                  -------------------End of Traders Loop-------------------


                  Next, the caves loop (line 650) is executed where teh temp quantity of each cave is set as the cave's current quantity.
                  1st iteration: Cave = ("Boulderfall Cave", prismarine, 10)
                  This iteration is skipped as the material in this cave is not sold by any traders (prismarine is not sold by any traders)


                  2nd iteration: Cave = ("Castle Karstaag Ruins", netherite, 4)
                  The calculate_cave_returns function is called on this cave since its material has a selling price set by the trader (lea)
                  In the calculate_cave_returns() function:

                  The calculate_cave_returns function is called on this cave since its material has a selling price set by the trader (orson)

                  Next, the cave_emerald_returns list is arranged into a MaxHeap based on the keys of the two materials i.e. 7.255369928400955 & 3.487518355359765
                  The topmost element in the heap would be (7.255369928400955, Castle Karstaag Ruins) followed by (3.487518355359765, Glacial Cave) since
